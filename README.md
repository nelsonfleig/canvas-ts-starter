# Webpack TS Starter

Basic boilerplate to start new HTML5 Canvas projects with Typescript.

## Features

Work in progress...

But hopefully some of the main features will be:

- Vector util class for more of a p5.js type experience
- Some helpful utils for getting a random integer from range, perlin noise, and more... (probably just taken off the p5.js source code)
- Typescript
- Webpack with HMR
- Eslint, prettier, husky, and all that jazz
